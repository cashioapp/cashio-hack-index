After some early success by ourselves, our friends and family started asking if we could invest money for them. In last 10 months we took money from over 20 local people (friends, family, teachers) here in Turkey. Before the hack we were managing 4.2m usd with ~50% in CashioApp earning a good stable yield. This hack has turned things really bad for us, we are stopping trading end of month and with no future plans. We were doing very good in yield farming before the hack but now we are badly down especially for new people that joined. Anything you can give back will be sent back to the people we know, some of them really need it and were not expecting a loss like this.",
