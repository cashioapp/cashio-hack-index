I'm a collage student of China, my money comes mainly from my parents and part time work after class. Although crypto was banned by our goverment, I'm keeping interesting and trying it out since I believe this is an unstoppable trend for young people like me. Solana is one of my favorable layer one chain due to the speed and low gas fee, by that I can try every protocol on it without worrying about gas expense. I tried Cashio a couple of month ago and thought it would be promising stable coin protocol, while I'm pretty shocked by know this unlimited mint issue. Although I'm prepared to take risks in crypto, if I got the chance to get refund that would be highly appreciated. Afterall, to be honestly, this is not a small money from my current stand.\n\nAppreciate.\n\nLex",
