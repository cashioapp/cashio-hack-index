First I thank you so much for refunding hack victims.\nI made 2 wallets the other day in the Cashio project, of which 1 is a phantom wallet that has been refunded by you. I still have this 1 wallet because I use coin98 wallet so I don't know how to switch to phantom wallet so at that time I couldn't create a refund request form, after a while I also knew how to login my account to phantom wallet so I recreate this request. I also don't remember exactly how much I lost when I was hacked, because the price was quite volatile at that time, so I didn't have the heart to check. Hope you consider refunding the money for me, as the amount is quite large for me as well. Thank you very much!\n",
