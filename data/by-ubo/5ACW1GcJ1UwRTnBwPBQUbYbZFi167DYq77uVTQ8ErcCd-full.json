Hello, I am originally from Western Siberia and spent most of my life there. This money belongs to me and my family, our lifetime savings. I am native Ukrainian holding a Russian passport and in the first place I’d like to mention that our family does not support the war in Ukraine and consider Putin a war criminal! There is a real war going on where the country I live is attacking the country of my grandparents. We didn’t choose to become in this situation, never voted for the current criminal government or supported them in any way. It is becoming more like Northern Korea than the USSR. I will try to explain the situation without going too much into personal details since I cannot go fully public to avoid criminal prosecution for just saying as above. My grandparents are 100% Ukrainian and I have cousins there, but now most of the family is still in Siberia, that is a quite common reality for the people here. We are not American, nor European and never inherited wealth, never ran any big business, never stole any money from anyone, never enjoyed any social bonuses that western countries provided, just average people. We had to survive in poverty during the 1990s after the USSR collapsed. In fact, I am the only member of the family who speaks more or less good English and understands something about crypto. My mom is Ukrainian, she was a scientist but now she is 75 and her medical conditions worsen every year. She has Parkinson's disease along with the heart condition and could barely look after herself. We had to hire a helper to assist with her day-to day care as it is becoming a full-time job. She needs a lot of necessary treatments, like PDS operation which cannot be done in Siberia, and the cost alone is around $50k and the overall costs may be well above $250k if considering traveling to another country, following support and hospital costs etc. There is no insurance coverage for that, none of us had anything like insurance! Her pension is only around $200/month, quite average for these realities. My father is 75 as well, he is better but he still could not retire and will continue working full-time as a uni professor because the cost of living is worsening every day and the medical expenses are just keep growing up, they jumped 20% for the last month and keep going. His salary is probably $500-600 a month since the ruble collapsed ~3x for the last few years. My father’s new wife has barely no income right now and his son (my stepbrother) is a student with just pocket cash and sporadic income. I still have to support them as a part of my family and they rely on the funds also. My wife has a part-time job as a photographer and she supports her old mother as well. Her sister is working a low-paying job, maybe $300/month and her niece is a young medical student with no hope of getting a high-paying job. Doctors do not earn much in this part of the world either.\nOur cousins are in Ukraine, right now we lost contact with them because of the war, people really suffer there, russian troops destroy Ukrainian cities with no mercy and we could not afford going there seeking them right now.  Most likely they need immediate help. My sister and her husband are just average, they are paying mortgage and work 9-7 during the week, average salary may be close to $500-600 right now with the rub/usd rate as of now. I was never a high earner either, just a programmer. In Siberia my top salary would be $1000/month. I was the only person to be able to manage the funds for the all these people, made stupid mistake of creating a concentration in Cashio and feel deeply responsible for the situation. More about the situation here: the inflation has hit 2%/week just recently, there is no sugar in the stores, some items got 16-20% more expensive and the situation keeps worsening because of the war and the sanctions. Unemployment keeps growing and the criminal situation will only worsen. Lots of people are quite anxious and depressed because of what is happening, they have no choice to oppose the totalitarian regime as it is quite easy to get big fines, jail time or get tortures by the police. We were hoping the funds would help to cover the needs during the hard times and now when they came we lost them with no hope of earning them back again. Some of us had to take cash loans to support the immediate needs but I see no opportunity to repay them considering the interest rates of 20% and above. All of us are anxious and stressed, we see no way of earning the funds back and see no hope for a brighter future. I apologize for the lengthy and sporadic message, just tried to explain the situation the way it is.

My sister and her husband are just average, they are paying mortgage and work 9-7 during the week, average salary may be close to $500-600 right now with the rub/usd rate as of now. I was never a high earner either, just a programmer. In Siberia my top salary would be $1000/month. I was the only person to be able to manage the funds for the all these people, made stupid mistake of creating a concentration in Cashio and feel deeply responsible for the situation. More about the situation here: the inflation has hit 2%/week just recently, there is no sugar in the stores, some items got 16-20% more expensive and the situation keeps worsening because of the war and the sanctions. Unemployment keeps growing and the criminal situation will only worsen. Lots of people are quite anxious and depressed because of what is happening, they have no choice to oppose the totalitarian regime as it is quite easy to get big fines, jail time or get tortures by the police. We were hoping the funds would help to cover the needs during the hard times and now when they came we lost them with no hope of earning them back again. Some of us had to take cash loans to support the immediate needs but I see no opportunity to repay them considering the interest rates of 20% and above. All of us are anxious and stressed, we see no way of earning the funds back and see no hope for a brighter future. I apologize for the lengthy and sporadic message, just tried to explain the situation the way it is.
