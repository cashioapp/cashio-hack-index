I have been really struggling mentally this past week.\nI certainly don’t want to lie to you. I’m European, but I’m not from a rich European country. This was all the money I have to live, and 195,000 is less than a small flat.\nIn summary, I saved this this money to feel comfortable and just to live and not get sick from overworking. It won’t buy me lambo or whatever, but just cover my living costs and my $170k loan on my flat I need to pay.\nI do appreciate you at least contacted us with all the misinformation and silence we had to deal with from the team in the past few days.\nI just don’t want to start from square one again. I hope you can consider my request. It would kill me inside knowing I have to work another 12-15 years trying to save this money and build my life back.\nThank you.",
