I moved this money onto the blockchain from my savings account (fiat to FTX over to Phantom).

Looking back I wish I would have used this money to pay off medical bills rather than trying to earn interest to pay them off. The honest answer is I need this money back because it took me many years to earn this amount and I have payment obligations that I need the money for (or the interest I was earning on it, which I was \"farming\" almost daily\"). I don't come from money (both parents work at grocery stores and are still working) and general life expenses (and kids) have made saving hard. I saw you returned all money to those under $100,000, which was the right thing to do - I hope you can do the same for those of us under $200,000. This money means a lot to me and my family. \n",
