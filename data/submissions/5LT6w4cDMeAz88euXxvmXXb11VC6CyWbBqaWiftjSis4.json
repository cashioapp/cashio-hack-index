Hello sir.My name is Ben Kendzicky.I know my LP was>$100,000 but hoping you will hear my request. My dad died on 26Dec2021 unexpectedly from Covid. Here is a link to his obituary to verify: https://www.borekjennings.com/obituary/David-Kendzicky He ran a small flooring business for 20yrs and was very close to retiring. He put most of his savings into stablecoin farming hoping to make 12% per year. This yield would be supplementary income for him&my mum once he retired. My mum now has to raise our family of 9 by herself. It has been extremely difficult on her & our family&this situation is more stressful. She is burdened with medical bills &this $280k is needed to support our family, especially after father’s death. Here is proof.
