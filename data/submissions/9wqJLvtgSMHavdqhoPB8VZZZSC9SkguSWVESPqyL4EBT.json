Literally don't know how to do this just want my money back\n5. I had a Quarry Cash/Cow LP with about 25,000 LP tokens... IDK how much money that equates to I am not a power user of Solana\n6. I am someone who dabbles in Solana and who was excited to use DeFi and thought that the Cash/Cow LP on Quarry seemed really interesting. I have lost over $1000 because of this hack, and I know you probably will not approve me since I do not know how to provide the proper data, but I hope you will consider doing it because I am not some rich person. I can't afford a house and I'm not sure I will be able to at this rate anymore.",
