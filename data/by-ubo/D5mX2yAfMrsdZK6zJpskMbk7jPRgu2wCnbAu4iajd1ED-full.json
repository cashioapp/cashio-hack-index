I will need it back because grandparents passed away last year, dad is out of job, bro got retrenched twice (was in oil industry) and I am the only one with some defi knowledge (learned through self reading). Am hoping to help family ease some financial burden through defi (more on stables farming as its safer). As you can see, i have failed very terribly because upon depositing money to form LP tokens, i totally missed the last step of \"depositing\" into the pool to earn APY. So hence missed out on farming the last 1-2 months. And not only that, now this is worthless. I still have much to learn to help myself and my family. I appreciate it if you can return this little amount to me. Will mean a lot to us.",
