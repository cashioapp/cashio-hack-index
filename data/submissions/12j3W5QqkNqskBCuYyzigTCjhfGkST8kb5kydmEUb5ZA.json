This money is part of my savings. Most of my savings are in DeFi since I don't believe in my government ability to keep our currency safe (Thailand). I am not as badly affected as others who put up more than $10k, but I hope you can consider giving back the fund. I have less than $100k overall. I thought this would be safe from price fluctuation and didn't think it would be targeted by hacks. I will be more careful of which protocols to put my money in next time.\n\n",
