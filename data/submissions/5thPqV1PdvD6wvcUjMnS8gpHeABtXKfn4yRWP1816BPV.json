During the 2020 Covid-19 outbreak in China, the restaurant I ran didn't hold up and I lost a lot of money. In the same year, I learned about defi and invested all my remaining savings into defi. The sad thing is that in this incident I lost almost all my funds, 200, 300usd (including the cny I borrowed from my father and uncle, about 700,000 cny). Although this money may not seem much, it is already all my savings and the part I borrowed from my family. My father is a farmer, and this money is also his pension money. I cannot afford the consequences. I told my family that defi is It is very safe, and you can get much higher returns than bank fixed deposits. I know I was wrong, I hope if you can see this message, if you can consider giving me these back and let my life go on, I promise to never put these loans and savings into defi again in the future, Thank you very much.\n\nAmount lost: 200, 361.37\n\nIf you can return it, I will represent my father and my uncle, thank you so much!",
