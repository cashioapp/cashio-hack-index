I am very new to crypto and found a project in Saber I thought I could trust and got duped by their marketing so I accept my stupidity.\nI have spent the past 10 years of my life religiously saving up to try and finally escape the rat race, working long hours. I managed to save by reducing my living costs and investing a small part each month.\nI thought this was a financial opportunity to give me some freedom from working long hours. I was wrong.\nI got in a position this year to quit my job to try and become financially independent, and I made a stupid mistake to put it in a liquidity pool with a high APY thinking it was safe.\nBut unfortunately it has been my single biggest mistake and has ruined my life, and I feel that all my hard work from the past years has just vanished with this hack and I’m back to zero again. I have been really struggling mentally this past week.\nI certainly don’t want to lie to you. I’m European, but I’m not from a rich European country. This was all the money I have to live, and 195,000 is less than a small flat.\nIn summary, I saved this this money to feel comfortable and just to live and not get sick from overworking. It won’t buy me lambo or whatever, but just cover my living costs and my $170k loan on my flat I need to pay.\nI do appreciate you at least contacted us with all the misinformation and silence we had to deal with from the team in the past few days.\nI just don’t want to start from square one again. I hope you can consider my request. It would kill me inside knowing I have to work another 12-15 years trying to save this money and build my life back.\nThank you.",
