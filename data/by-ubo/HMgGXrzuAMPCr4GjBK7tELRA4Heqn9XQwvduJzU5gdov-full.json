I know even if the hack didn't happen my cows would only be worth about 30$ and after the hack it's only 3$, I want my 30$ back and I think I'll give my daughter I go eat kfc instead of participating in this horrible cryptocurrency market.\nI don't speak English, this letter was written by google translate, I'm from Vietnam and my 1 month income is only about 300$ from doing airdrop missions of some crypto projects only.\nthanks, best regards\nP/S: please send me 30$ back and if possible send me via bnb chain, I don't have money to pay eth withdrawal fee.\n",
