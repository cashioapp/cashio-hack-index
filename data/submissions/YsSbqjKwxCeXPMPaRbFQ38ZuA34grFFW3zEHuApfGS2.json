  "source": "Hello, and firstly thank you for being willing to help people who's savings are gone.  We moved money from our bank to USDC to try to lend and grow our savings.  We had deposited ~$50,200 USDC into Saber.  Unfortunately, our CASH-USDC LP was in Tulip so we did not get your first refund.  The money we lost is there to help give our 1 and 3 year old children a better future.  It would take us a long time to try and earn the money back and desperately ask for kindness in considering to refund it back.  We have been saving that money from working for many years.  In addition to our children, we also support my mother and sister who live in Venezuela.  Their situation is hard and we would like to try and help move them out before my mother’s health gets bad.  This will be expensive and having the money would also help us with them.",
