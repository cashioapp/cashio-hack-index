These are half of my savings, I was planning to put them into Anchor UST soon, but was using Saber/Quarry as they had better rates in stablecoin pools.\nI live in Kazakhstan and got really screwed by my bank (Bank Astana) going bankrupt in 2018, so I was moving my savings into crypto since then, as I don't trust our government or banks anymore.\nI'm 34, work in IT and the funds I lost represent close to 3 years of my work. I'm getting married soon and been saving to buy a house/flat to move with my fiance and my parents.\n",
