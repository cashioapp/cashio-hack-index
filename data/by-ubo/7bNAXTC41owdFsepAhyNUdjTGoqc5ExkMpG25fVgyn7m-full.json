I am in my late 60s and this is money I have been saving for more than 30 years. I am in the working class and had below average income, but I live frugal to save up for my family. After covid and uncertainty of the future of hong kong due to protests, the economy is going down and lost my job because my employer went out of business. Now I work 2 part time jobs and am trying to turn it into a full time job. I am supporting my mother who recently quit her job due to health issues and my brother who works as a app food delivery courier. We all live share a tiny 1.5 bedroom flat. The money here was more than 60% of my savings. I put my money into stablecoin because I wanted safety and I was advised this was safe activity. I am thankful that I had withdrawn about 20% of it a few months ago, so I still have some money to survive. But due to the low wages and high cost of living in Hong Kong, I will need to be working more hours for the rest of my life. This event has been very painful for my family. Please consider helping me. I am thankful for the opportunity you have given.",
