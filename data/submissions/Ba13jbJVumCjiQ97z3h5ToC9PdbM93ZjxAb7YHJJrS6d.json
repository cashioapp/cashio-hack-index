When the hack happened, a lot of people did arbitrage CASH from other pools to dump on us. People dumped CASH for our tokens in the pools then sell them to USDC. We lost a lot of money due to these arbitragers. In emerging countries like us, this amount of money is big and can support hundreds of dev to have a better life. we are working tirelessly and this money is really important to us so we really hope that you might consider to refund us the money. It means the world to us.",
