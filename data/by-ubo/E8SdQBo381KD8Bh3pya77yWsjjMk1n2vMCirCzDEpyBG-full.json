Hello my name is David, I am reaching out because I was greatly affected by the Cashio hack :( I used to be diagnosed with kidney disease which caused me to look into crypto while doing my steroid treatment. I then started with leverage trading and build my way up to $25k from $500. Then I found Solana and invested some of my money into that, after a slight pump I switched over to Cashio and I started putting all my profits into it. I was greatly affected by this, even though I am in remission of my kidney disease I still need to go in monthly for appointments that cost $1k+ because I have no insurance because I physically can't work. If you could even refund 25% it will be greatly appreciated. Thank you guys so much for allowing me to plead my case. I am just trying to live my best life.",
