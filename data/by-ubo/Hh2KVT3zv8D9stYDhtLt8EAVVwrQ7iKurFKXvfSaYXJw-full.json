Cashio.app project is very good. I spent a lot of time learning and researching about this project. I am a young student with a desire to earn money to cover my life and take care of my family. I borrowed $40,000 to invest in the project from buying COW and CASH but I lost money and had to sell off what I had to make ends meet. When CASH fell, I thought it was some glitch, so I spent the rest of my money buying CASH in hopes of making a profit. But when I found out that CASHIO.App was attacked by hackers, I was almost desperate and had negative thoughts. When I read that you are a 16 year old hacker, I was surprised because we are the same age, but you have done a big thing, YOU are SO GOOD. Now I hope to receive the above amount to partly pay off my debt and cover my life. Wish you more success. Thank you very much.",
