I am currently a university student in Pathum Thani, Thailand (here is my student ID card: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FM1N9DT-CUTRM2LrUvQoz0lQgDg1JrPQ/view). I used my next semester tuition fee to invest in the C98, then I farmed C98-CASH LP with the hope that it is a temporary investment to help me earn an amount of money to buy food and pay for my rental fee. I added LP from Saros Finance and farmed on Quarry. This is a big amount of money for me because it is the whole of my next tuition fee, my family is in debt so they do not have much money to cover the loss. I intended to withdraw the LP, sell to USDC and cashout to pay my tuition fee with will be open for registeration on the mid of April. Therefore, I was very shocked last week when I heard Cashio was attacked. However, I am feel grateful that you decided to refund for people who need their money. Please consider me and refund me my tuition fee, I am happy and ready to answer anything regarding to the funds and investment so you can check and do the refund, my email is truc.doan@bumail.net , thank you so much for your kindness.",
