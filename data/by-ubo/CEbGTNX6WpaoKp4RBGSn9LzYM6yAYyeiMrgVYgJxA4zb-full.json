I have so scared that is why I have unstake all of my Liquidity token from the Quarry Farm. I have LP in 2 pool, they are CASH-COW (Sencha LP) and C98-CASH (Saros LP)\nHere is the proof:\nThe C98-CASH LP amount is 10,222,933 which is around 2370 C98 with 4200 CASH, the total is more than $8,200 :((((((((((\nhttps://solscan.io/account/HYUNVQ73Zi6yRSoVe6xhofreNs5LQq1XWNmURZ9q9Q3V#splTransfer\n\nThe COW-CASH LP is 1,616,808, it use to worth a lot, but before CASH was hack, it worth around $400, I think so.\nhttps://solscan.io/account/HbBCtPRHZuck8UkmwZAKnpvGFq3PggFV6ZcBiyVYzuMS\n\n4. After those LPs were worthless, I withdrew Liquidity Tokens and sold them, then I got about $40.\n\n5. I really don't know how much I want to get back, I hope you guys will sympathize and give me back the capital I have deposited is about $8,500. I'm so sorry to write $8,500 because it's not your responsibility to pay, but since it's all to me I look forward to it. Thank you very much.\n\n6. Please allow me to explain why that amount is very important to me. Currently I am 30 years old and married, I am working with my daily job as an office worker. Every year I have about $1,500 left over and I use that money to invest in the hope that my family has a better life.\nWith a little over $8,000, that's more than five years of savings. And because I am Vietnamese, I believe in the values ​​they bring to the community, so I have invested in C98 for the long term, hoping to have money for my family and parents in the future.\nRight now, I'm very depressed, because that's the whole fortune of a worker in Vietnam. At such an age, I no longer have the ability to earn more and regain the lost money while I have to take care of my family and parents when they are old.\nPlease, please help me one time. I will forever be grateful for your help. I know it's not your responsibility to pay, and it's a sin to bother you with this message. But I beg you. Thank you very much, thank you very much.",
