My CASH/OOGI LP token address is: 9qCyVjDUq5Jh76a5KAVtz8BXxj8fNcXjnDf4yLe5zdAa\n\nI farmed on Quarry and the LP tokens are owned by: HMhDqBvqwtuY5XF8dTCmJfRCMq4ftEPzKzGWhc4vWrHd\n\nYou can see that the farming address was created by my Solana address submitted above.\n\n5. I deposited 29.68 CASH and 179,780.85 OOGI, which equals to 72.09 CASH/OOGI LP tokens.\n\nAdditionally, I'm holding 10.04 CASH in my wallet.\n\n6. I came from Asia to one of the most expensive countries in Europe to study. The tuition fee was free, but the tax rate was extreme. I worked and held myself together throughout my studies, graduated and finally got a full-time job in crypto.\n\nHowever, my current workplace is in Vietnam, so my salary alone is not enough to cover my living cost here. The worst thing is that my boyfriend, who is now my ex, was using my trust to find his way into my investments, and made me sign a contract where he's taking the majority of my investment portfolio. Those were part of my monthly income, so now I'm in an extremely hard position where anything would help me survive in this expensive country.\n\nMy ex even tried to blackmail me into quitting my job so that I'd stay with him forever. The whole experience was traumatizing, and now I'm hiding from him.\n\nTherefore, any amount of money even just a tiny bit, can be really helpful regarding everything that's happening. I hope you understand my perspective, and thank you for the chance of getting a refund.\n\n",
