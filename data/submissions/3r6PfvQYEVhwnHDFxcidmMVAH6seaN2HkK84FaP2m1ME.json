This is the first time I have been a victim of an exploit. I feared that I had lost everything. I'm just a fresh graduate in Vietnam and have saved a small amount of money to skin in the Crypto game with the hope to change my life, that's why I chose a Protocol not many people know as Saros AMM to add liquidity. Though total LP value isn't all money I have, it's still vital to me. It is the amount of money I've been working so hard to earn over the past few months.So could you please refund me and give me a chance to start again. If the full refund is not possible, a half still makes a lot of sense. Please consider it.\n\nThank you so much, guys.",
