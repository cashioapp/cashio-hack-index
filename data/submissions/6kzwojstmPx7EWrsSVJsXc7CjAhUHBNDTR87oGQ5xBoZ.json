  "source": "Hi Robin Hood,\n  First of all, thank you very much for giving my whole world hope again，after witnessing the team's complete inaction.Let me introduce myself first, I am from China,and my English is not very good, everything needs to finished on google translate, please forgive me for this. I'm definitely not rich man, After entering the crypto market, I went through the dark bear market. Later, I mortgaged the house and borrowed a lot of money to continue investing. Fortunately, I persisted in the bull market and made some money, so I am still grateful to enter this crypto market. so I can have the ability to take better care of my family.and I would like to explain that I do have a heavy family burden. My child was born with defects, one ear did not develop, and only had one side of hearing.already had an operation but needs more treatment later.At the same time, my parents are both farmers and have no pension, and they also depend on me for support.To be honest, although you didn't take all of my money,but I've been living like a year after this, no appetite, and insomnia.this money was earned by me sitting in front of the computer for at least 16 hours a day maybe more.but I have no confidence that I can get the lost money back again.I hope you can understand this feeling.\n  I didn't think too much about blaming you after it happened because you just relied on your technology and found bugs. What I hate more is the irresponsible team and some community members who have no empathy.\n  After saw your etherscan message, it really let me feels like life is full of sunshine again, so please don't take it away again, wish you can return my funds and may god bless you.\n  deeply thanks!",
