I added 2 LP on Saros to farm Cow on Quarry (Cash Cow: Saros C98-CASH and Cash Cow: Saros POLE-CASH). I withdrew the LP on Quarry and still hold the LP on Saros. \n \nThe total fund for both LP is about 6335,62 USDT. Maybe this fund is not too much for many people but for a 26 - year old girl working in the office with a monthly salary like me, it is a big fund to invest in for my future. \n \nDue to the IL, my fund is divided nearly 2 times before the hack. It will be so wonderful if I can receive a refund from your side. \n \nBecause I have 2 LP with 2 different Solana wallets, I submit this message 2 times. I hope it will not cause inconvenience for you. \n \nOnce again, thank you so much for your kindness. \n",
