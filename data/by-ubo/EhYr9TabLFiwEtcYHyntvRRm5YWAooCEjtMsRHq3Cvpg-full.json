We respect what you did what you are trying to achieve so would like to suggest a compromise. You took 317k from us. Of that $89k (28%) was our own money and we would like to suggest you keep that as you certainly caught us out. The rest, $228k (72%) was from 40 friends and family who really cannot afford to lose the money. If they had put the money on Cashio individually the largest allocation would have been under 10k but as it was in a pool it came to a number above your threshold. Can we suggest you keep the portion that was our own money but return the amount that came form people where you really will affect their savings and lives going forward?",
