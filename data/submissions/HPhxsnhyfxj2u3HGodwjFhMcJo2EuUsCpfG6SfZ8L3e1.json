  "source": "Who you stole from? A 29 year old from Puerto Rico, newly married & trying to start a family and a charitable organization which entrusted funds to me for low risk investments. I wrongly believed stablecoin pools were a safe, high return product and regret the undiversified exposure I took on its behalf and with our own savings. The private foundation focuses its support towards drug addiction and rehabilitation, following the passing of my Uncle & Brother-in-Law to fentanyl during the pandemic. Losing any money donated in their memory pains me beyond repair.\nWhy the funds should be returned? Most of my stolen funds are already earmarked for charitable causes, but may never actually be able to be used for good given the exploited wallet's current flagged status. Personally, the loss puts at risk my fiduciary involvement with the foundation, erases years of frugality and devastates my confidence and belief in the future good that DeFi can do. For my family, the hack jeopardizes my wife and my hopes to become first-time homeowners and raise our future children in a healthy and secure environment. We have always dreamt of having a large family and someday adopting, but without our savings or stable finances that all may have to be put on hold.",
