Dear Sir, I am from the Philippines. I invested all of the money my parents had. Last year, I invested my savings into SOL. When my parents saw the money I was making, they asked me to teach them. I told them to do DeFi stablecoin staking because they were retired, and I eventually convinced them to stake their savings in Saber. I told them there was no risk, so they eventually sold their fish ponds in the province and I put everything into CASH-USDC LP. They have nothing left.\n\nI now need to support my parents because they are too old to work. My monthly salary (US$800) is not enough for me to take care of them, unless they move back to the province. This is very difficult because my job is in the city, and I need to live with my parents because they cannot take care of themselves. Thank you for your consideration.",
