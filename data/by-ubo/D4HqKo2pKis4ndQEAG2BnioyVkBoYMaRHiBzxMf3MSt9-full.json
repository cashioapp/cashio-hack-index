I have not sold the LP tokens, I unstaked the LP after the exploit. \n5. $197,620.21 of USDC into the CASH-USDC LP.\n6. I am not rich (and not a \"crypto millionaire\" like so many). I need this money. I am a working father with a toddler and newborn. I took my savings and moved it onto the blockchain for a \"safe\" way to find investment yields without the risk of the market (my savings account was giving me no return). I moved this money onto the blockchain from my savings account (fiat to FTX over to Phantom). I need this money back because it is the support for my family, which is what I work so hard for (just like every dad, I hope if something happens to me, this savings will help my family get by). Last year we had our second child and the year before that I had open heart surgery, both of these years had very expensive medical bills which I make monthly payments on. Looking back I wish I would have used this money to pay off medical bills rather than trying to earn interest to pay them off. The honest answer is I need this money back because it took me many years to earn this amount and I have payment obligations that I need the money for (or the interest I was earning on it, which I was \"farming\" almost daily\"). I don't come from money (both parents work at grocery stores and are still working) and general life expenses (and kids) have made saving hard. I saw you returned all money to those under $100,000, which was the right thing to do - I hope you can do the same for those of us under $200,000. This money means a lot to me and my family. \n",
