The reality is that I do not know what exactly to say or where to start, so I will just speak from my heart because I have no other choice.\n\nBefore I begin, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for having the mercy to consider my request. I know you have no reason to believe me or anyone else submitting requests for refunds. I also know that you must be receiving vitriolic and hateful messages every day. I will not be one of them. The reality is that even if I did hate you, which I do not, I could never hate you more than I already hate myself.\n\n\nThe reality is that I was already suicidal before the night I discovered the exploit. I have been battling PTSD and treatment resistant depression all my life. That said, the CASHIO exploit has put me over the edge, and I am struggling to find reasons to live as I write this. I can share any and all medical records evidencing my lifelong battle with treatment resistant depression. I have tried everything, including Electroconvulsive Therapy (i.e., induced seizures) in 2016 and ketamine infusions in 2020. I can share evidence of these treatments upon your request. As I write this message, I am heavily medicated and fighting severe anxiety. I sincerely thank you for taking the time to read this. I will do whatever you demand of me to get this money back. I have no ego.\n\nBefore I address the source of funds, kindly allow me to first tell you more about me, which will lend color as to my psychological state, and then I will explain the source of funds and why I need them back.\n\nI am Kashmiri. That means I am from Kashmir, a wartorn, disputed territory in South Asia that has been under military occupation by India and Pakistan since the late 1980s, with both direct and indirect facilitation by the United States, who has done absolutely nothing to help the innocent Kashmiri people, my people. The Kashmiri people are disenfranchised and have no future. They have no autonomy or control over their fate. I have lost innocent family members and my closest friends to senseless violence. I have personally held, in my arms, three innocent cousins shot to death by the military in Srinagar, Kashmir. Other family members of mine have been raped and physically abused, their homes destroyed for no reason. You may now understand that it is no coincidence that I have suffered from PTSD and severe depression all my life. If you are unfamiliar with Kashmir or the conflict there, I humbly request you research Kashmir for just 5 minutes on the internet to confirm my representations. I want you to know that the foreign policies and actions of the United States are directly and indirectly responsible for the death of my family members and loved ones in Kashmir and the fate of Kashmir itself. Like you, I understand at least as much as anyone else that the United States has profited off of the military industrial complex for a very long time. I understand more than anyone else your aversion to wealthy people in the United States and Europe who do not care for human beings elsewhere. Truly, there are good and bad people all over the world. \n\nMy family fled Kashmir in the late 80s at the peak of violence in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, with ~$1,000 - $2,000 (impossible to know the exact amount - this is what my mother tells me). I am my parents’ only son.  Needless to say, I grew up poor. One of my earliest childhood memories is my parents giving me a birthday present in an unlabeled box. In the box were a pair of used LA Gear shoes from Payless - the shoes probably cost $20 brand new and probably $2 used. Even as a kid, at that moment, I realized how little we had. As I grew older, around age 11, when I was conscious enough to understand the world and my family’s plight, I dedicated my life to making sure that both my immediate and extended family would never feel powerless again. More specifically, I dedicated my life to making as much money for my family because only someone who has experienced abject poverty can understand the importance of money.\n\nGrowing up, my parents always stressed the value of education, and yet, I only saw education as a means to making money - that was my only mission. I am not proud of this, and I am not saying that education does not matter. I am simply saying that it did not matter more to me than making money. So, I worked as hard as I could in school to get the best job I could get after graduation. After starting work, I saved as much money as I could after taxes. In 2017, I discovered Bitcoin. It immediately resonated with me because as a Kashmiri, whose nation was stripped of its autonomy and self-governance overnight, I knew better than anyone else the power of a non-sovereign, digital store of wealth. Bitcoin represented and still represents hope to me and other disenfranchised populations around the world. It represents freedom from rogue nations and wealthy, profiteering governments. Ever since discovering Bitcoin, I pooled whatever I could from my family and extended family to invest in crypto because I believed it would be the “future” and one of the best investments ever. Fast forward to January 2022, and the thousands of dollars I originally invested for my family and myself was suddenly worth millions. It was at that point in January 2022 (you can track this on chain) that I decided I had made enough for my family and me, more than I could ever dream of, so I decided to put the money in a “safe” yield generating vehicle with no impermanent loss - that vehicle was the CASH-UST LP on Quarry. So, to be clear, the source of the funds I lost in the CASHIO exploit is the vast majority of my years of accumulated money from investing both my family’s and my own money dating back to 2017. I started with about $80K in total. The reason there is $2,873,321.20338 of funds lost in this CASHIO exploit is NOT because I came from money. It is because I invested everything I could (~ $80K) in crypto in 2017 to change my family members’ lives forever. When I put the money in the UST-CASH LP on Quarry and CASH in January 2022, it was with the intention of finally focusing my attention on my lifelong battle with severe depression and PTSD from my childhood, while still growing the accumulated wealth passively. My family has been begging me to take care of myself once and for all, and I was finally ready to save my own life. Again, I can prove everything I am saying. Please feel free to ask me for proof.\n\nNow that I have explained the source of funds, I hope it is clear why I need the money back. This money is not only mine. It is my family’s as well. They do not know anything about crypto. They are Kashmiri refugees whose biggest accomplishment was surviving and fleeing Kashmir in the 80s. It is not the money of those with intergenerational wealth or trust fund babies in America or Europe. This is the money of those who deserve it. This is the best kind of money, it is the money made by people who grew up with nothing and made every dime by their own efforts. It is the money of people whose people were raped and pillaged by powerful governments in a conflict that rages on even today. \n\nI am officially broken and have nothing left in me. As I stated above several times, I will do whatever you require to prove to you that my story is real. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. I have no ego and only respect for you. The reality is that most people who pulled off the exploit you executed flawlessly would never return the money. It is clear you have a heart, and I pray to the powers that be that you can feel mine through this message. If you are ever able to see my medical history, you will understand that you can truly save my life and the lives of my parents, who are in their elder years, and truly cannot bear the pain of seeing their son deteriorate.  \n\nWith head on the floor, I request your mercy. My best,\n\nA boy from Srinagar, Kashmir all grown up and trying to support my family and save my own life\n",

The reality is that I do not know what exactly to say or where to start, so I will just speak from my heart because I have no other choice.\n\nBefore I begin, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for having the mercy to consider my request. I know you have no reason to believe me or anyone else submitting requests for refunds. I also know that you must be receiving vitriolic and hateful messages every day. I will not be one of them. The reality is that even if I did hate you, which I do not, I could never hate you more than I already hate myself.\n\n\nThe reality is that I was already suicidal before the night I discovered the exploit. I have been battling PTSD and treatment resistant depression all my life. That said, the CASHIO exploit has put me over the edge, and I am struggling to find reasons to live as I write this. I can share any and all medical records evidencing my lifelong battle with treatment resistant depression. I have tried everything, including Electroconvulsive Therapy (i.e., induced seizures) in 2016 and ketamine infusions in 2020. I can share evidence of these treatments upon your request. As I write this message, I am heavily medicated and fighting severe anxiety. I sincerely thank you for taking the time to read this. I will do whatever you demand of me to get this money back. I have no ego.\n\nBefore I address the source of funds, kindly allow me to first tell you more about me, which will lend color as to my psychological state, and then I will explain the source of funds and why I need them back.\n\nI am Kashmiri. That means I am from Kashmir, a wartorn, disputed territory in South Asia that has been under military occupation by India and Pakistan since the late 1980s, with both direct and indirect facilitation by the United States, who has done absolutely nothing to help the innocent Kashmiri people, my people. The Kashmiri people are disenfranchised and have no future. They have no autonomy or control over their fate. I have lost innocent family members and my closest friends to senseless violence. I have personally held, in my arms, three innocent cousins shot to death by the military in Srinagar, Kashmir. Other family members of mine have been raped and physically abused, their homes destroyed for no reason. You may now understand that it is no coincidence that I have suffered from PTSD and severe depression all my life. If you are unfamiliar with Kashmir or the conflict there, I humbly request you research Kashmir for just 5 minutes on the internet to confirm my representations. I want you to know that the foreign policies and actions of the United States are directly and indirectly responsible for the death of my family members and loved ones in Kashmir and the fate of Kashmir itself. Like you, I understand at least as much as anyone else that the United States has profited off of the military industrial complex for a very long time. I understand more than anyone else your aversion to wealthy people in the United States and Europe who do not care for human beings elsewhere. Truly, there are good and bad people all over the world. \n\nMy family fled Kashmir in the late 80s at the peak of violence in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, with ~$1,000 - $2,000 (impossible to know the exact amount - this is what my mother tells me). I am my parents’ only son.  Needless to say, I grew up poor. One of my earliest childhood memories is my parents giving me a birthday present in an unlabeled box. In the box were a pair of used LA Gear shoes from Payless - the shoes probably cost $20 brand new and probably $2 used. Even as a kid, at that moment, I realized how little we had. As I grew older, around age 11, when I was conscious enough to understand the world and my family’s plight, I dedicated my life to making sure that both my immediate and extended family would never feel powerless again. More specifically, I dedicated my life to making as much money for my family because only someone who has experienced abject poverty can understand the importance of money.\n\nGrowing up, my parents always stressed the value of education, and yet, I only saw education as a means to making money - that was my only mission. I am not proud of this, and I am not saying that education does not matter. I am simply saying that it did not matter more to me than making money. So, I worked as hard as I could in school to get the best job I could get after graduation. After starting work, I saved as much money as I could after taxes. In 2017, I discovered Bitcoin. It immediately resonated with me because as a Kashmiri, whose nation was stripped of its autonomy and self-governance overnight, I knew better than anyone else the power of a non-sovereign, digital store of wealth. Bitcoin represented and still represents hope to me and other disenfranchised populations around the world. It represents freedom from rogue nations and wealthy, profiteering governments. Ever since discovering Bitcoin, I pooled whatever I could from my family and extended family to invest in crypto because I believed it would be the “future” and one of the best investments ever. Fast forward to January 2022, and the thousands of dollars I originally invested for my family and myself was suddenly worth millions. It was at that point in January 2022 (you can track this on chain) that I decided I had made enough for my family and me, more than I could ever dream of, so I decided to put the money in a “safe” yield generating vehicle with no impermanent loss - that vehicle was the CASH-UST LP on Quarry. So, to be clear, the source of the funds I lost in the CASHIO exploit is the vast majority of my years of accumulated money from investing both my family’s and my own money dating back to 2017. I started with about $80K in total. The reason there is $2,873,321.20338 of funds lost in this CASHIO exploit is NOT because I came from money. It is because I invested everything I could (~ $80K) in crypto in 2017 to change my family members’ lives forever. When I put the money in the UST-CASH LP on Quarry and CASH in January 2022, it was with the intention of finally focusing my attention on my lifelong battle with severe depression and PTSD from my childhood, while still growing the accumulated wealth passively. My family has been begging me to take care of myself once and for all, and I was finally ready to save my own life. Again, I can prove everything I am saying. Please feel free to ask me for proof.\n\nNow that I have explained the source of funds, I hope it is clear why I need the money back. This money is not only mine. It is my family’s as well. They do not know anything about crypto. They are Kashmiri refugees whose biggest accomplishment was surviving and fleeing Kashmir in the 80s. It is not the money of those with intergenerational wealth or trust fund babies in America or Europe. This is the money of those who deserve it. This is the best kind of money, it is the money made by people who grew up with nothing and made every dime by their own efforts. It is the money of people whose people were raped and pillaged by powerful governments in a conflict that rages on even today. \n\nI am officially broken and have nothing left in me. As I stated above several times, I will do whatever you require to prove to you that my story is real. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. I have no ego and only respect for you. The reality is that most people who pulled off the exploit you executed flawlessly would never return the money. It is clear you have a heart, and I pray to the powers that be that you can feel mine through this message. If you are ever able to see my medical history, you will understand that you can truly save my life and the lives of my parents, who are in their elder years, and truly cannot bear the pain of seeing their son deteriorate.  \n\nWith head on the floor, I request your mercy. My best,\n\nA boy from Srinagar, Kashmir all grown up and trying to support my family and save my own life\n",
