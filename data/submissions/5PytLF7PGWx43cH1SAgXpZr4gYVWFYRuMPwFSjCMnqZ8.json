CASH-USDC LP (formerly in Sunny Pool) & CASH-SUNNY LP (formerly with quarry)\n   3.a.

I hold CASH token in that wallet that I obtained recently buy selling the COW rewards from my CASH-SUNNY LP.  I did not own any CASH coin directly (other than the two LP's mentioned previously) prior to the hack and this CASH account is separate.\n4. Proof of ownership in token accounts listed in item 3\n5. CASH-USDC value prior to the hack was around $4000 USD.  CASH-SUNNY value was around $400 USD.  Total amount of loss: $4400 USD.\n6. The source of this money was from my job.  I'm the only working member of my household.  I have always worked 40-70 hours a week since I was 16. I try to invest anything I have above our expenses so I can retire some day and spend more time with the family.  I frequently open my door to let (sometimes even strangers) stay with us in a time of need and am very generous with the little bit of money I have.  In all honesty, I can survive without the $4400 and I'm sure there are people out there that may need it more.  However, I worked my butt off for that money.  It does hurt us a bit and it will take me a lot of work to make up for it again.  I'm pretty much always working and am unable to save much money.  I would be grateful if the money was returned.  As a software developer, I do pretty well financially, but most of my money goes back to either my family (e.g., wife, daughter, dad is in a wheel chair) or people in need.  I recently gave a friend in need a $5500 dollar car in order to get back on her feet and get to and from work.  Due to this, I'm down to one vehicle in a family of three and the vehicle breaks down frequently.  I was planning to use the money from that LP to buy a used vehicle.",
